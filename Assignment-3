MYSQL
1. Create a php page and create a user form which asks for marks in five subjects out of 100 and then
displays the mark sheet of the student. The format is as follows:
Name of Student*:
Marks in Each Subject
Subject 1* : 
Subject 2* :
Subject 3* :
Subject 4* :
Subject 5* :
Total Marks Obtained: 
Total Marks: 
Percentage:
Note: All the entries marked (*) are to be input by the user. And use a submit button to post the entries
in the form using the POST method. The data gets saved in a MySQL Database named "result" and
table named "class1". with each user assigned a unique numeric id (AUTO INCREMENT TYPE).The
following is the format to store the data in the result database:
id(BIG INT), name(CHAR), sub1(INT), sub2(INT), sub3(INT), sub4(INT), sub5(INT), total obtained
(INT), total marks(INT) and percent(FLOAT).


<?php

echo "Enter the mark1\nEnter the mark3\nEnter the mark3\n";

$mark1=trim(fgets(STDIN));

$mark2=trim(fgets(STDIN));

$mark3=trim(fgets(STDIN));

$total=($mark1+$mark3+$mark3);

echo "Total number =".$total;
>


2. In the previous assignment use the following data: 
Name: Rohan
Marks in Subject(s): 55,66,77,88,76
Now write a PHP Script to update the values in the database with the new marks in subject 5 as "99"
and recalculating and updating database entries: total obtained and percent.
