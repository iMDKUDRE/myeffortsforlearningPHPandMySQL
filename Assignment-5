<?php  
 $connect = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "testing");  
 session_start();  
 if(isset($_SESSION["username"]))  
 {  
      header("location:entry.php");

      {  
           $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($connect, $_POST["username"]);  
           $password = mysqli_real_escape_string($connect, $_POST["password"]);  
           $password = md5($password);  
           $query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES('$username', '$password')";  
           if(mysqli_query($connect, $query))  
           {  
                echo '<script>alert("Registration Done")</script>';
